This library contains the [CARP core](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.core-kotlin) model as implemented in Dart. It contains the domain model for the [carp_mobile_sensing](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_mobile_sensing) framework and all of its supporting libraries, packages, etc.

This package does nothing on its own.
